# RESTfulFastAPI

## This is just a simple Application Programming Interface in Python that was written with the FastAPI web framework. 

The functionality of this API is pretty simple, as it consists of the basic methods: **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.
The API is based on getting and creating a simple database of employees with the use of Python programming language, **FastAPI** (framework), **SQLAlchemy** library, **SQLite** database, **Uvicorn** ASGI server implementation and **Pydantic** library.
The initial purpose of this simple API was to later check for its vulnerabilities via SQL-injection and XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.
